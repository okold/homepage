            <p id="author" class="text-center">Olga Koldachenko</p>
            <p>I engaged the shuttle’s thrusters, feeling gravity press down upon me as I landed upon Lobo 10-13. I leaned back in my seat and took in the landscape framed by the windshield. I’d landed behind a concrete garage with a prefab housing unit attached to its side. Surrounding it was nothing but barren wasteland, broken down the middle by a single road leading to the planet’s capital. Hovering above the cityscape down the hill was an enormous saucer, casting its dark shadow over the populace. The carrier arrived once every two standard years, the United Galactic Republic’s reminder that this was not, in fact, an isolated colony.</p>

            <p>The dashboard picked up the local environmental broadcast, reading 38 degrees Celsius. It was a far cry from the air conditioning I’d become used to, so I shed my suit jacket and tie, tossing them on the passenger seat. I rolled up my sleeves then checked my pockets, making sure everything was in order, then I opened the glove compartment and eyed my pistol.</p>
            
            <p>I picked it up, checked that it was loaded, and holstered it on my belt. </p>
            
            <p>The driver’s door opened with a hydraulic hiss and I hopped down onto the earth below. </p>
            
            <p>I made my way toward the front of the building and passed an RV parked in the shadow of the garage’s western wall. A fat tabby cat was sprawled out on its back in my path, staring at me with green eyes. I crouched down to pet it and it let out a low mrowl, nicking my right hand with its claws and springing away to the top of the vehicle.</p>
            
            <p>I hissed in pain, looking down at the red line along my thumb, the blood dripping onto the soil, then glared up at the beast. It stared at me with slitted green eyes, flicking its tail in agitation.</p>
            
            <p><em>Just watch me,</em> I thought, as if the cat could hear what I was thinking.</p>
            
            <p>I rounded the corner and heard decades-old pop music playing over a tinny speaker nearby, some melodramatic love song with a catchy tune I heard on the radio as a kid. The garage door was down, but a window at the front of the building was cracked open. I looked into the cluttered workspace inside: parts, tools, and boxes strewn about in a haphazard fashion. Lining the back wall was shelving, stocked to the brim with robots and other machines in various states of dismantlement, each covered in sticky notes. Sitting on a mat on the ground was a utility bot shaped like a trash can, its maintenance hatch open and a cable routing from it to a console on a desk nearby.</p>
            
            <p>A young woman sat at that desk, slumped in a rolling chair, watching a graph on the screen with a furrow in her brow. She wore denim overalls, and there were goggles sitting on her forehead that kept herk messy red curls out of her face. She took a swig from the mug in her hands then whined, “This is dumb. I replaced the part, checked all the connectors, updated the BIOS just in case, and it’s still not detecting the stupid sensor-”</p>
            
            <p>She was going to continue her rant, but she as she turned in her chair, she caught eye of me in the window. Her cheeks grew red. I smiled and gave a little wave with my injured hand. Startled, she placed her mug down on the table and stepped over a box to come closer to me.</p>
            
            <p>“Oh my god, are you okay?”</p>
            
            <p>“I don’t think your cat likes me very much.” It wasn’t a big deal, and I hoped I came across as such.</p>
            
            <p>“I’m so sorry. He’s usually so sweet. Hold on, let me get the door, and the first aid kit.” </p>
            
            <p>The woman disappeared from sight, to some corner of the garage I couldn’t peer into.</p>
            
            <p>Another voice spoke up, deep and tobacco-scarred: “What’s going on?”</p>
            
            <p>Her answer was distraught. “Leo hurt a customer.”</p>
            
            <p>The garage door rumbled. I left the window to stand in front of it, waiting patiently as it rolled up, bringing with it a burst of cold air.</p>
            
            <p>I froze in place.</p>
            
            <p>Sitting in the centre of the garage wasn’t another consumer robot like the one the woman was working on, but a ten-foot-tall military machine straight out of my nightmares. </p>
            
            <p><em>I was twelve years old as I watched the Legion march from my bedroom window, soldiers in combat armour backed by rows of monstrosities I’d heard my sister call “spider tanks”. I thought they were cool at first, looking through pictures on the Internet: the black-plated robot’s wheels lay at the end of tripod limbs and heavy guns were mounted on two arms. The Empire’s sigil was painted in white on one shoulder and each had a single red light on its face.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Sirens wailed in the distance. Mother pulled me down from the chair.</em></p>
            
            <p>“The sink’s over there.”</p>
            
            <p>The voice broke me out of my stupor. The woman was at my side, pressing a towel into my hand. As I took it to cover the cut, I noticed the man standing nearby. He stood a full head taller than me, dressed in a loose sleeveless shirt and cargo pants, dark stains and smudges marking his clothes. His right arm was mechanical, the hand swapped out for a screwdriver kit. With the deep lines on his face and trimmed grey beard, I nearly didn’t recognize him, but I could never forget those eyes.</p>
            
            <p>Those tired, blue eyes.</p>
            
            <p>“That cat doesn’t like me either,” he said. “Fickle little creature.”</p>
            
            <p>“Don’t call him that,” the woman huffed as she lead me to the back corner of the garage, by a door and window that looked into the attached building. “Wash up, then I’ll apply the antiseptic.”</p>
            
            <p>“Thank you.”</p>
            
            <p>When my hand was freshly bandaged up, she asked me with a customer service tone, “With that out of the way… is there anything we can do for you?”</p>
            
            <p>I glanced at her, then glanced at the man. “I’m looking for Richard Knox.”</p>
            
            <p>“Call me Rick.”</p>
            
            <p>“Thanks, Rick. I’m Devon. I -ah, I heard about your work.” I tried my best to sound civil. “I got a recommendation from one of the jockeys on the saucer. My shuttle makes a weird noise when I land. I was wondering if you could take a look at it.”</p>
            
            <p>Richard first looked at the woman, then eyed me carefully. He answered with a flat tone, “Diagnostics are five hundred credits upfront. I’ll be able to take a look at it today, but I can’t make any promises on the turnaround time. If I can’t get it fixed by the time the saucer leaves, you can take it back as-is with the diag sheet, but you’re not getting a refund.”</p>
            
            <p>“That’s fine.”</p>
            
            <p>“Sierra can help you out with the check-in.”</p>
            
            <p>I fought down a pang of disappointment. I was so close. “Right, thank you for your time.”</p>
            
            <p>I reached out with my left hand to shake. Richard had a firm grip, his warm hand scarred and calloused. After two shakes, I suddenly felt conscious of how clammy mine was, and when the mechanic released me, I wiped my palm on my pant leg.</p>
            
            <p>Sierra returned after putting away the first aid kit, gesturing toward the door by the inner window. There were two steps going up to it, guarded with a thin metal handrail. “Alright, let’s check you in.”</p>
            
            <p>I followed her inside, closing the door behind me. Daylight spilled into a homely office. A ceiling fan spun through the air, casting long shadows on the ceiling. Under the window was a seating area: a well-word couch and a coffee table with a small TV mounted in one corner. Sierra approached the desk in the opposite corner, a leafy house plant sitting on the ground beside it.</p>
            
            <p>I couldn’t help but ask, “So what’s with the tank?”</p>
            
            <p>“Tank? Oh, Captain? That’s Rick’s pet project. I see that look on your face.” Sierra waved her hand dismissively. “It’s nothing but a scarecrow, keeps the critters and drunks out. Someone was taking pot shots last night and damaged a leg.”</p>
            
            <p>“That’s a Legion weapon, how’d he get his hands on that?”</p>
            
            <p>“No idea,” she answered without a care, looking through the desk’s drawers for something. “Lots of junk ends up here, we might as well make use of it.”</p>
            
            <p>Sierra pulled out a tablet and pen and opened a crude app. She guided me through pages of forms with practiced boredom. I needed to fill out my personal information, my licence information, notes of any existing damages, personal data collection waivers, my warranty status and the like. At the end was a form to waive away my right to sue. “It’s to protect both of us,” she explained with an apologetic smile.</p>
            
            <p>I surrendered my keys and transferred the credits.</p>
            
            <p>When I swallowed, my throat incredibly dry. As Sierra looked over the transaction, I spoke up again, “Sierra, could I please have some water?”</p>
            
            <p>She stopped and placed the tablet down, but her voice took on a slightly different tone. “Of course, Devon.”</p>
            
            <p>My heart began to race.</p>
            
            <p>She left through a door behind the desk marked “Employees Only” with a hand-written sign, leaving me alone in the office. My eyes wandered back toward the garage. Richard was adjusting something on the tank’s leg and I gave it another look. It was painted bright red with black racing stripes along its body, and the guns on its arms were replaced with three-fingered claws. It was slumped in an off position, but I couldn’t help but feel that it could come alive at any second.</p>
            
            <p>Sirens rung in my mind.</p>
            
            <p>“Devon?” I didn’t notice that Sierra had returned. She was by the desk, giving me a concerned look. “Are you okay?”</p>
            
            <p>I shook my head and accepted the glass in her hands. “I’m okay. Thank you.”</p>
            
            <p>The water was cold and I washed it down in a single go, as if it would help me with my convictions. The knot in my stomach only grew tighter. I tried to make casual conversation, “So, how long have you been working here?”</p>
            
            <p>Sierra looked up as she thought. “It’s been about two years now.”</p>
            
            <p>“Do you like it?”</p>
            
            <p>“Oh yeah, it’s amazing. Best job I’ve ever had.” A wide smile broke into her expression. “Rick’s been an amazing mentor. I know my way around a bot, but Rick, he’s next level. He can work on five machines at once!”</p>
            
            <p>“So I’ve heard.”</p>
            
            <p>Just on cue, Richard stepped into the office carrying a toolbox. He’d swapped the screwdriver kit with a proper metallic hand. He approached Sierra and gestured toward the garage. “I’m about done with Captain’s repairs. Can you finish up the post diagnostics for me? I’ll take a look at Devon’s shuttle, so he can be on his way.”</p>
            
            <p>She let out a wave of relief. “Sure thing, Rick.” She turned to me and politely tipped her head. “It’s a pleasure meeting you, Devon! You have a good day now.”</p>
            
            <p>She entered the garage with a calculated level of calm.</p>
            
            <p>One moment, I was watching Sierra approach the robot through the window.</p>
            
            <p><em>The next, my sister at the head of the protest.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Nothing but a girl, her heart filled with hope, dreaming of a world free from all-seeing eyes bolted to street signs and lamp posts. At night, she’d whisper to me of a time before wars and curfews, when children played freely outside. No morning recitals and funerals.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>The Legate appeared personally to deal with this threat. He had her hands bound behind her back, tied to a post. Everyone in town was brought to watch, Mother and I at the front of it all. He gave the signal, then a tank riddled her with so many holes that her flesh became nothing but red paste to be washed from the street like refuse.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>When it was done, he turned around and his eyes met mine.</em></p>
            
            <p><em>Those cold, blue eyes.</em></p>
            
            <p>“Alright, let’s see the damage.” Richard’s voice broke through my thoughts.</p>
            
            <p>“Thank you again.”</p>
            
            <p>I’d been thanking people a lot that day and this time I caught myself, hoping in that moment that I didn’t sound too strange. Rick didn’t seem bothered. He picked up my keys and the tablet, reading it over as he made his way to the front door. I followed him outside, onto the faux wood porch. We walked down the steps and rounded the corner, towards the RV. I looked up at the roof and didn’t see the cat.</p>
            
            <p>“How’s the hand?” Richard stopped and looked me in the eye.</p>
            
            <p>I could see red through the bandage. “It’s fine.”</p>
            
            <p>He grunted in acknowledgement and kept going. I pointed out my shuttle, an unpainted flying car of a previous-century design. Average but reliable. It had accompanied me on my journey for the last five years, and it felt odd seeing Richard stand beside it. He put the tablet down on his toolbox and moved forward to inspect it, his back turned. </p>
            
            <p>Now was my chance.</p>
            
            <p>Heart racing, I unholstered my gun and pointed it at him.</p>
            
            <p>My voice was clear, “Maverick Barolo.”</p>
            
            <p>The mechanic went still. He slowly rose to his full height and just as slowly turned around. There was a blank look on his face when he asked, “What did you say?”</p>
            
            <p>“Legate Maverick Barolo of the former Galactic Empire, Third Quadrant.” I’d repeated those words to myself over and over, the mantra keeping me going for ten long years. “Am I wrong?”</p>
            
            <p>He looked at my gun, then at me.</p>
            
            <p>“That’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time.”</p>
            
            <p>I reaffirmed the grip on my pistol. “Put your hands where I can see them.”</p>
            
            <p>He raised his arms into the air. I still couldn’t read his expression and felt wired to spring. He had more muscle mass than me, more training. If I wasn’t careful, he could easily overpower me and I’d lose this opportunity for good, but I found my trigger finger stiff.</p>
            
            <p>Richard- no, Maverick never broke eye contact. “You some sort of bounty hunter?”</p>
            
            <p>“No, this is personal.”</p>
            
            <p>The price on his head was buried in a database in the capital, eight years old and nearly forgotten. The rest of the officers in the Legion were executed one by one after the coup, but Maverick Barolo went MIA. Most assumed he was dead somewhere, floating in deep space, but if anyone could bring in his head, they’d be rewarded five million credits.</p>
            
            <p>I didn’t want the money. I’d send it to Mother. I imagined her now, sitting on the porch in her rocking chair with a book in her frail hands, hooked up to an IV. She wanted me to stay at home, to forget my hunt, but I couldn’t be rid of the sirens wailing in my head, sick music punctuated with gunfire drums.</p>
            
            <p>“Tell me, then, what did I do to you?”</p>
            
            <p>“What did you do?” I enunciated, anger flaring within me. “Don’t play games with me! You know exactly what you did.”</p>
            
            <p>“During my life back then, I’ve hurt enough people for the count to be nothing but a faceless statistic. I don’t doubt you’re one of them, Devon,” I hated hearing him speak my name, “but I don’t remember you. Before you kill me, I’d like to know: what did I do to you?”</p>
            
            <p>I took a shaky breath. “The Kodiak incident.”</p>
            
            <p>Maverick’s eyes grew round. He sighed, dropping his shoulders.</p>
            
            <p>“She was important to you, wasn’t she?”</p>
            
            <p>“She was my sister.”</p>
            
            <p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
            
            <p>Unwilling to hear it, I strode forward until I was only two paces away. Still, I couldn’t pull the trigger. I wondered, <em>why?</em> Why wasn’t he fighting? It would’ve been so much easier if I’d found the monster from my nightmares, with a taste for bloodshed and no wide-eyed apprentice trailing behind.</p>
            
            <p>“You’ve never killed a man before.” He called me out, then took a step forward.</p>
            
            <p>I couldn’t supress the tremor that wracked my body.</p>
            
            <p>“Stay put!”</p>
            
            <p>My shout didn’t deter him as he took one more step. He was close enough for me smell sweat, oil and cigarette smoke. He placed his metal hand on top of the barrel of my gun, gripped it tightly, then pressed it directly against his heart.</p>
            
            <p>“End it.”</p>
            
            <p>I tried to move my gun, but couldn’t.</p>
            
            <p>“Why?” I asked numbly.</p>
            
            <p>“Because every night, I hear their screams.” Richard hissed. “The chip in my head won’t let me silence them.” He snarled, his presence becoming violent. “If you think it’s right, then <em>end it!”</em></p>
            
            <p>A loud crack echoed through the air.</p>
            
            <p>I’d pulled the trigger without thinking.</p>
            
            <p>I watched the life fade from his eyes, his body dropping to the ground with an unceremonious thud, my pistol joining him soon after. The single gunshot repeated in my head, punctuating the rest of the music. The smell of blood filled my nose, the ground at my feet turned from brown to red.</p>
            
            <p>I’d played this scene out in my head on repeat, but now that I was here…</p>
            
            <p>I fell to my knees and retched.</p>
            
            <p>There was a shout to the side. My hands were shaking uncontrollably, but I picked up my pistol anyway, forcing myself to stand. It was done, now. There was no going back. I turned my head and my heart lurched. It was like looking into a mirror.</p>
            
            <p>Sierra, eyes wide with horror, then hate.</p>
